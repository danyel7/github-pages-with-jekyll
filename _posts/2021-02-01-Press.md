If I can't practice, I can't practice. 
If I'm hurt, I'm hurt. Simple as that.
It's not about that at all. But it's easy to talk about and sum it up when you just talk about practice; 
we're sitting here, and I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice.
I mean, listen, we're talking about practice. Not a game! Not a game! Not a game! We're talking about practice.
Not a game; not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it's my last, not the game, we're talking about practice, man.
I mean, how silly is that? We're talking about practice. I know I'm supposed to be there, I know I'm supposed to lead by example, I know that.
And I'm not shoving it aside like it don't mean anything. 
I know it's important. I do. I honestly do. But we're talking about practice, man. What are we talking about? Practice? We're talking about practice, man!
